# Ascend

A final school project made in c#.

This project was fully developed by me because my teammate didn't know how to code xd.

It took me a lot of hours but I think they were worth it.

I am very proud of this project and I hope it helps other programmers.

This project is meant to give you acces to bots

It is needed and acces key connected to a database in https://keyauth.com/ because I didn't have time to do a database and it also has more functionalities that were useful.

I connected the program to a discord server, if you want to join, here is the link: https://discord.gg/S4PAqTUp2g

Hope you like it!
